# FLC-Hackfest-2022 - Technoflash

## Problem Statement: 

There is a need to develop solutions to track all activities of a student including academic progress in real-time. Often it is observed that students are also good at co-curricular activities. In the current situation, it is not possible for a lecturer to pay attention to every student. Hence a web portal

- that tracks the student’s achievements in real-time by giving the students access to upload details with supporting documents, verified by the lecturers

- Allows lecturers to maintain the students' anecdotal record based on class behavior and presence

- Student’s academic performance maintained in the same platform (portal).

## Software used:

Frontend - `HTML`, `CSS`, `JavaScript`, `Bootstrap`

Backend - `PHP (8.1.5)`

Distribution - `XAMPP (3.3.0)`

Database - `MySQL` 

Code Editor - `VSCode`
